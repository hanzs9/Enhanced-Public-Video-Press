### Methodology

##### Collect information
It is convenient and easily to use smart
phone to take videos in our phone applications. The only requirement is that the phone should include at least one camera. When you open the application, there are two parts in the main screen. One is a map which shows the users’ location. The other is a camera button.

##### Analyse data
All videos will be sent to the server and
saved in database. After that, the videos will be analysed and sorted to different categories. For example, it detects the moving pixels’ colour of flame and the contours of the images by edge detection to judge whether it is fire or not.

##### Take action
After the videos are sorted to various
categories, the videos will be uploaded to website which is public to everyone. The web page will mark the location of each video. Appropriate actions are expected to be taken by government or fire brigade or police station.
